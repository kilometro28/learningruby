--- Classes ---
Instance variables (attributes) are variables
that belongs to the object.
Attributes provide information about the
object's current state.
Instance methods interact with the object.
Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restricts
direct access to an object.

--- Classes and Objects ---
A class is the blueprint, pattern, template or
outline for an object.
An object is the instance of a class. It is created
from a class.
Instantiation is the process of creating an object
from a class.
A class is called an abstract type because it hides
the complexity of interacting with data, much like
a method abstracts the complexity of a process.
