# Intro to modules

- A module is a toolbox or container of methods ands constants
- Module methods and constants can be used as needed
- Modules create namespaces for methods with the same name
- Modules cannot be used to create instances
- Modules can be mixed into classes to add behavior

# Syntax and style

- Module names are written in UpperCamelCase
- Constants in modules should be written in ALL CAPS
- Access module methods with the dot operator (.)

- The :: symbol is called the scope resolution operator
